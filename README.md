This study examines the relationship between lead exposure and incarceration rates in California census tracts, focusing on blood lead levels (BLL) in children, who are particularly vulnerable to lead contamination. Using data from 2020, we employed spatial cross-validation and log-transformed regression models to predict incarceration rates, considering demographic factors like income, race, and age. The analysis found weak correlations between BLL and incarceration rates, with income, age, and racial composition emerging as more significant predictors. The final model demonstrated moderate explanatory power (R-squared = 0.495). Our findings suggest that BLL is not a significant predictor of incarceration rates, emphasizing the stronger influence of socioeconomic and racial factors.
