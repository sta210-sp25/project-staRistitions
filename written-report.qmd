## **Introduction**

Could exposure to lead increase one's likelihood of going to prison? After our team's systematic review of studies, we have explored the potential effects of lead exposure on brain development in children and adults. Various existing studies highlight the detrimental effects of lead on different brain regions, noticeable in a decrease in executive control and cognitive control, thereby affecting memory, mood, behavior and comprehension skills. Such exposure to lead during the developmental years of children causes irreversible damage, the effects of which can be seen later on in life. 

Studies in the past, such as one conducted by Talayero et al. (2023)^1^, have highlighted a strong association between lead exposure during childhood and criminal tendencies during adulthood. One can be exposed to lead through different means, including water, which is the medium which we’ve chosen to investigate. Our research topic inquires about whether a relationship exists between a specified area's water lead levels and its incarceration rates, while also considering potential confounding effects of other demographic factors.

This research topic has important societal implications, namely the complicated intersection of crime, environmental racism, and more. It’s an ever relevant question today and we hope to come to meaningful conclusions by the end of our analysis. Our initial hypothesis is that there is a positive relationship between water lead levels and the rate of incarceration with the existence of other interaction effects from things such as race and income. However, we acknowledge the intricate combination of social and institutional factors that increases one's likelihood of incarceration and are understand the possibility for inconclusive findings with the focus on lead exposure.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**

### **Our Data**

We've chosen to create our dataframe from a variety of census data relating to California in 2020. Our data looks at different California census tracts and their respective statistics relating to blood lead levels, income, incarceration rates, and racial demographics. For our analysis, we are particularly focused on `perc_bll_indicator`, `med_income`, our age and race variables and how well they can predict `imprisonment_rt`.

### **Data Exploration**

**Incarceration Rate**

```{r}
#| label: carc-dist

carc_limit <- quantile(bll_data$imprisonment_rt, 0.99, na.rm = TRUE)

bll_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = imprisonment_rt)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "lightblue4") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1250)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Imprisonment Rates in CA",
    subtitle = "per 100,000 by Census Tract",
    x = "Imprisonment Rate (per 100,000)",
    y = "Count",
    caption = "Capturing ~99% of data"
  ) +
  theme_classic()

carc_med <- median(bll_data$imprisonment_rt, na.rm = TRUE)
carc_iqr <- IQR(bll_data$imprisonment_rt, na.rm = TRUE)
```

After removing extreme outliers (the top 1% incarceration rates - some may ultimately be removed because the census tract has an extremely low population ex. \~3 people), the shape of the distribution is unimodal and right skewed. The median incarceration rate is `r carc_med` out of 100,000 with an IQR of `r carc_iqr`. This doesn't appear surprising - there are fewer census tracts with particularly high imprisonment rates.

**Blood Lead Levels**

```{r}
#| label: lead-dist

quantile(bll_data$perc_bll_indicator, 0.99, na.rm = TRUE)

bll_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = perc_bll_indicator)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "lightblue4") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 12.5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Children Under 6 
    with High Blood Lead Levels in CA",
    subtitle = "by Census Tract",
    x = "Children under 6 with a BLL ≥3.5 µg/dL (%)",
    y = "Count",
    caption = "Capturing ~99% of data"
  ) +
  theme_classic()

bll_med <- median(bll_data$perc_bll_indicator, na.rm = TRUE)
bll_iqr <- IQR(bll_data$bll_indicator, na.rm = TRUE)
```

There are 94 census tracts that didn't test blood lead levels in this data. These will likely need to be removed because these observations are not useful in the analysis. Additionally, there is a large concentration of census tracts that have a percent blood level indicator of 0 (1899 observations). While these should probably be included in the final analysis, removing these for data visualization produces a unimodal distributon that is heavily right skewed. Overall, the median blood level is `r bll_med` and the IQR is `r bll_iqr`.

**Income**

```{r}

#| label: income

quantile(bll_data$med_income, 0.99, na.rm = TRUE)

bll_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = med_income)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "lightblue4") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 200000)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Median Income in CA",
    subtitle = "by Census Tract",
    x = "Median Income ($)",
    y = "Count",
    caption = "Capturing ~99% of data"
  ) + theme_classic()

inc_med <- median(bll_data$med_income, na.rm = TRUE)
inc_iqr <- IQR(bll_data$med_income, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The shape of the income distribution is also unimodal with a less extreme right skew and a median value of `r inc_med` and iqr of `r_inc_iqr`. This doesn't appear surprising - we'd expect median incomes of tracts to be concentrated towards the left.

**Spatial Distribution**

![Spatial Distribution of BLL in California](data/Layout.png){width="200"}

Especially since census tracts can be extremely small, we'd have to account for spatial dependence in our analysis.

```{r}
#| label: bivariate-exploration

bll_data %>% 
filter(perc_bll_indicator <= quantile(perc_bll_indicator, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(imprisonment_rt <= quantile(imprisonment_rt, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(num_bll != 0) %>% 
filter(perc_bll_indicator != 0) %>%
  
ggplot(aes(y = imprisonment_rt, x = perc_bll_indicator)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 0.6, color = "lightblue4") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 0.6, color = "black", linetype = 2) +
  labs(title = "Imprisonment Rate vs. Blood BLL Indicator",
       y = "Imprisonment Rate",
       x = "Percentage with BLL Indicator",

  theme_classic()



bll_data %>%

filter(imprisonment_rt <= quantile(imprisonment_rt, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(num_bll != 0) %>% 
  
ggplot(aes(y = imprisonment_rt, x = med_income)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 0.6, color = "lightblue4") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 0.6, color = "black", linetype = 2) +
  labs(title = "Imprisonment Rate vs. Median Income",
       y = "Imprisonment Rate",
       x = "Median Income") +
  theme_classic()



bll_data %>% 
filter(perc_bll_indicator <= quantile(perc_bll_indicator, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(imprisonment_rt <= quantile(imprisonment_rt, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(num_bll != 0) %>% 
  
ggplot(aes(x = age_15_to_29, y = imprisonment_rt)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 0.6, color = "lightblue4") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 0.6, color = "black", linetype = 2) +
  labs(title = "Imprisonment Rate vs. percentage age 15-29",
       y = "Imprisonment Rate",
       x = "Percentage of population age 15-29") +
  theme_classic()  
```

Imprisonment rate and the percentage of a census tract with a high blll has a generally positive correlation. Imprisonment rate and median income has a generally negative correlation. Imprisonment rate and percentage of population aged 15-29 in the census tract has a generally positive correlation.

**Potential Interactions**

```{r}
#| label: interaction-effects

bll_data <- bll_data %>%
  mutate(POC_other = black + native_am + other_race, 
         race_categorical = ifelse(POC_other > median(POC_other, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                   "above_median_poc_other", 
                                   "below_median_poc_other"))

bll_data %>% 
filter(perc_bll_indicator <= quantile(perc_bll_indicator, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(imprisonment_rt <= quantile(imprisonment_rt, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(num_bll != 0) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = med_income, y = imprisonment_rt, color = race_categorical)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between income and imprisonment",
    subtitle = "By median percentages of Black, Native American, and other races",
    x = "Median Income",
    y = "Imprisonment Rate",
    color = "Above or below median"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

When comparing the relationship between median income and imprisonment rate, it appears that generally they have a negative correlation. This graph suggests there could be an interaction effect between race and income, as the relationship between median income and imprisonment rate differs by race. We created a categorical variable for the percentage of the census tract population that is black, native american, or "other race" that is categorically above or below the median in the data. The relationship between imprisonment rate and median income appears more negatively correlated when categorically above the median census tract population percentage of black, native american, and other_race. This supports that there could be an interaction effect between race and income.

**Splitting the Data**

We are concerned about spatial correlation, so we will split the data 75/25 to minimize this effect.

```{r}
#| label: splitting

set.seed(210)

bll_sample <- sample_frac(bll_data, 0.2)
bll_testing <- anti_join(bll_data, bll_sample)

```

**Checking Initial Modelling Conditions**

```{r}
#| label: intial-conditions
library(knitr)

#filtering data points where num_bll = 0
bll_data_model <- bll_data %>% 
  filter(num_bll != 0)

bll_full_model <- lm(imprisonment_rt ~ perc_bll_indicator + POC_other + med_income + median_age + perc_male + med_income * POC_other, data = bll_data_model) 

tidy(bll_full_model) %>% 
kable(digits = 3)

set.seed(210)

full_model_aug <- augment(bll_full_model)

#there is one point with a residual so large the graph is not readable if we keep it. Filtering it out.
full_model_aug |>
  filter(.rownames != 2421) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs Fitted Values",
    x = "Fitted",
    y = "Residuals"
  )

vif_fm <- vif(bll_full_model)
vif_fm

#There does not appear to be too much multicollinearity.

```

1.  Normality condition can be relaxed.
2.  Linearity condition not satisfied. Points not randomly scattered around the x = 0 line.
3.  Constant variance condition not satisfied. Points fan out across the x = 0 line.
4.  Independence condition also may not be satisfied. Census tracts next to each other could be more likely to have similar incarceration rates or blood lead levels.

```{r}
#| label: linearity?
#Now going to check for linearity between variables to see if we need to transform any.

bll_data_model %>% 
  filter(perc_bll_indicator <= quantile(perc_bll_indicator, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
filter(imprisonment_rt <= quantile(imprisonment_rt, 0.98, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
 select(imprisonment_rt, perc_bll_indicator, med_income, median_age) %>%
 ggpairs()
```

```{r}
#| label: log_transformation
#used +1 to avoid log(0) issues? Idk that was new for me and not sure we need to keep it.
bll_data_model <- bll_data_model %>%
  mutate(
    log_med_income = log(med_income + 1),       
    log_imprisonment_rt = log(imprisonment_rt + 1) 
  )

log_model <- lm(log_imprisonment_rt ~ log_med_income + perc_bll_indicator + 
                POC_other + median_age + perc_male, data = bll_data_model)

log_model_aug <- augment(log_model)

log_model_aug |>
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs Fitted Values",
    x = "Fitted",
    y = "Residuals"
  )


vif_fm_log <- vif(log_model)
vif_fm_log

```

The residual plot looks way better except for that one stripe of residuals. I am not sure what is causing that. The VIF values are awesome and super low too. Ignoring the stripe that would violate our other conditions, I am going to try a stepwise model selection.

The stripe could be due to census tracts next to each other influencing each other? This could be a good graph to show in class.

```{r}
#| label: model-selection

library(MASS)


stepwise_model_mass <- stepAIC(bll_full_model, direction = "both", trace = 1)


summary(stepwise_model_mass)


library(broom)
tidy(stepwise_model_mass) %>%
  kable(digits = 3)

```

Interestingly, the lead predictor was removed through stepwise selection, perhaps indicating that it is not useful here.
